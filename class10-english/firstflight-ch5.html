      <h2>📘 The Hundred Dresses – Part 1</h2>
      <p class="content-box-10">
        “The Hundred Dresses – Part 1” by Eleanor Estes tells the story of Wanda Petronski, a poor Polish girl who wears the same faded blue dress to school every day. Her classmates, especially Peggy and Maddie, tease her for this, but Wanda calmly claims she has a hundred dresses at home. The story highlights the effects of teasing and the importance of kindness, empathy, and understanding others’ feelings. Wanda’s dignity and quiet courage teach readers that mocking someone for their differences can hurt deeply, and that compassion is more valuable than cruelty.
