<div class="qa-item">
  <button class="qa-question-10">Why did Nelson Mandela say freedom is indivisible? (CBSE 2016‑17)</button>
  <div class="qa-answer-10">
    Nelson Mandela explained that freedom is indivisible because no one can be truly free while others remain oppressed. He realised that his own childhood sense of freedom was limited compared to the lack of basic rights for Black South Africans under apartheid. Mandela’s hunger for freedom shifted from personal to collective, making him fight for the freedom of all people in his country. He believed that if even one group remained in chains, then no one could enjoy complete freedom. Therefore, true freedom must be shared by everyone, putting an end to discrimination and restoring dignity to all citizens of South Africa. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

  <button class="qa-question-10">What did Nelson Mandela mean by saying the oppressor and the oppressed were robbed of their humanity? (CBSE 2012‑13 pattern)</button>
  <div class="qa-answer-10">
    Mandela meant that apartheid degraded not only the oppressed Black people but also the white oppressors. The oppressed suffered cruelty and loss of dignity, while the oppressor lost compassion, becoming blind to human values due to hatred and prejudice. This cycle of injustice dehumanised everyone in the society, making it difficult for either side to appreciate the worth and dignity of others. Mandela’s words highlight that true humanity is lost when people treat one another unjustly, and that liberation of both parties—oppressed and oppressor—is necessary to restore mutual respect and dignity in society. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

<div class="qa-item">
  <button class="qa-question-10">What ideals did Mandela set out for South Africa in his inauguration speech? (CBSE 2020–21)</button>
  <div class="qa-answer-10">
    In his inauguration speech as the first Black President, Nelson Mandela outlined several ideals for South Africa’s future. He pledged to liberate the people from poverty, deprivation, suffering, discrimination, and inequality. He promised justice, peace, and equal rights for all, striving to build a non‑racial, democratic nation. Mandela emphasised that the country must uphold its Constitution and ensure freedom and dignity for every citizen, regardless of colour or background. His vision was rooted in unity and reconciliation, aiming to heal decades of division caused by apartheid and create a society where everyone could live with self‑respect and equal opportunities. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

<div class="qa-item">
  <button class="qa-question-10">Why was the inauguration ceremony on 10 May 1994 a historic occasion? (CBSE 2015)</button>
  <div class="qa-answer-10">
    The inauguration on 10 May 1994 at the Union Buildings in Pretoria was historic because it marked the end of centuries of white minority rule in South Africa. Nelson Mandela’s election as the first Black President symbolised the triumph of justice, democracy, and racial equality after decades of apartheid. The ceremony brought together world leaders and people of all races, celebrating the establishment of a democratic, non‑racial government that recognised the rights of all citizens. It was a milestone in the nation’s struggle for freedom, reflecting hope for a future without discrimination and inspiring others worldwide to value equality and human dignity. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

<div class="qa-item">
  <button class="qa-question-10">How did Mandela’s ‘hunger for freedom’ transform him? (CBSE 2018‑19 pattern)</button>
  <div class="qa-answer-10">
    Nelson Mandela’s ‘hunger for freedom’ began with his realisation that his own freedoms were limited compared to the systemic denial of rights experienced by Black South Africans under apartheid. This awareness changed him from a normal young man into a determined freedom fighter. Instead of seeking personal freedoms, he sought freedom for his entire community. His commitment led him to join the African National Congress and endure long imprisonments and hardships. Over time, his struggle transformed him into a symbol of courage and resilience, turning him from a frightened individual to a bold leader devoted to equality, justice, and dignity for all people in his nation. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
