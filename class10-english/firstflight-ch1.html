  <div class="qa-item">
  <button class="qa-question-10">
 Lencho had faith in God but not in humanity. Elaborate with reference to A Letter to God.
  </button>
  <div class="qa-answer-10">
   Lencho’s unwavering faith in God is shown by his decision to write directly to Him for help after the hailstorm destroyed his crops. He believed that God alone could help him in his hour of need. However, when the postmaster and staff collected money for him, Lencho distrusted them and called them “crooks” for not giving the full amount. This shows that although Lencho trusted God completely, he lacked faith in human goodness. The story highlights how simple faith can be pure, yet human perceptions can be clouded by suspicion and misunderstanding.
  </div>
</div>

<div class="qa-item">
  <button class="qa-question-10">
   Why did Lencho say that the raindrops were like new coins? How did the same rain change the face of Lencho’s field?
  </button>
  <div class="qa-answer-10">
Lencho compared the raindrops to new coins because at first, he thought the rain would nourish his crops and bring a good harvest, just as money would bring prosperity. However, the rain suddenly changed into a destructive hailstorm that ruined his small field completely. The hail broke the corn plants and left the land bare, leaving Lencho and his family without food or income. Thus, what began as a hopeful shower turned into devastation, highlighting the irony and unpredictability of life.  </div>
</div>

<div class="qa-item">
  <button class="qa-question-10">
 Analyse the similarities and differences between the young seagull from ‘Two Stories About Flying’ and Lencho from A Letter to God in facing adversity.  </button>
  <div class="qa-answer-10">
In the Board Paper 2025, students were asked to compare the young seagull’s fear and Lencho’s crisis. Both characters face difficult situations: the seagull must overcome fear to fly, while Lencho must deal with the loss of his crops. The seagull’s challenge is internal—learning courage—whereas Lencho’s challenge is external—coping with destruction and seeking help. The difference lies in how they respond: the seagull pushes himself to act despite fear, while Lencho relies on faith in God to solve his problem. Both, however, show that belief—whether in self or in God—can give strength in adversity.
